The application is already equipped with a set of preloaded mock data. These mock data entries are presented alongside their corresponding tables, conveniently located on the right side of the interface. As you explore further, you'll notice that these tables have been populated according to an Entity-Relationship Schema. This schema is thoughtfully depicted on the left side of the interface, providing a comprehensive visual representation of the relationships and structures within the dataset.
